# Learning-English-Past-Tense-RNN
Code for a seminar work on the subject of *learning the English past tense using RNNs*.

This is a PyTorch implementation of the Annotated Encoder Decoder, an RNN described in Bahdanau et al. (2015),
built using the tutorial at https://bastings.github.io/annotated_encoder_decoder/,
for exploring Morris Halle's (1978) hypothesis regarding the encoding of phonemes as feature vectors
by a learner of a natural language.

For running the experiment, clone the repository locally and 
run _304366891_english_past_tense_rnn.py_ using python 3.6+ (64-bit), after installing the required libraries.

   Tested on Windows 10 and Linux, with python 3.6+

   Required libraries: (install using _python -m pip install <lib_name>_)
   - pytorch
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - scipy
   
  I've compiled installation scripts for Windows and Linux (should also work on a Mac), which
  can be found in this repository. 
  Notice that the Torch library is quite large (ca. 700 MB). Please be patient :)
